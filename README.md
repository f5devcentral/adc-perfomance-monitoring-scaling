The solution utilizes various third-party technologies/services along with F5â€™s automation toolchain including:
   
   - **F5 BIG-IP(s)** providing L4/L7 ADC Services
   - **F5 Declarative Onboarding**, (DO) and **Application Services 3 Extension**, (AS3) to deploy to configure BIG-IP application services
   - **F5 Telemetry Streaming**, (TS) to stream telemetry data to a third party analytics provider
   - **GitHub Actions** for workflow automation 
   - **Azure** public cloud for application hosting
   - **Hashicorp Terraform** and **Consul** for infrastructure provisioning, service discovery and event logging
   - **Third-party Analytics Provider **, (integrated with BIG-IP(s) via TS) for monitoring and alerting, (environment includes and ELK stack trial for testing/demo purposes)
