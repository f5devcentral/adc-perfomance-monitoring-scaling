ADC Telemetry-based Autoscaling
===============================
This solution, (see below) illustrates how F5's Automation Toolchain can integrate with third party analytics provider(s) to provide cloud-agnostic centralized application delivery monitoring and autoscaling.  

<img src="azure/images/arch.png" alt="Flowers">

The solution utilizes various third-party technologies/services along with F5â€™s automation toolchain including:
   
   - **F5 BIG-IP(s)** providing L4/L7 ADC Services
   - **F5 Declarative Onboarding**, (DO) and **Application Services 3 Extension**, (AS3) to deploy to configure BIG-IP application services
   - **F5 Telemetry Streaming**, (TS) to stream telemetry data to a third party analytics provider
   - **GitHub Actions** for workflow automation 
   - **Azure** public cloud for application hosting
   - **Hashicorp Terraform** and **Consul** for infrastructure provisioning, service discovery and event logging
   - **Third-party Analytics Provider**, (integrated with BIG-IP(s) via TS) for monitoring and alerting, (environment includes and ELK stack trial for testing/demo purposes)

## Deployment
Since the solution utilies Github Actions for orchestration it will be necessary to [duplcate the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/duplicating-a-repository) into a Github account under your control.
